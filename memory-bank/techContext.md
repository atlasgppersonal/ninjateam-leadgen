# Tech Context

## Technologies used:
- Python 3.x
- `requests` library for HTTP requests.
- `json` library for JSON manipulation.

## Development setup:
- Python environment with `requests` installed.
- Local HTTP function emulator running at `http://127.0.0.1:7001/fourth-outpost-470409-u3/us-central1/saveArbitrageData`.

## Technical constraints:
- The emulator expects a JSON payload.
- Network connectivity to the emulator is required.

## Dependencies:
- `requests` Python package.

## Tool usage patterns:
- `read_file` to inspect existing Python scripts.
- `write_to_file` to create and update Python scripts and Markdown files.
- `execute_command` to run Python scripts and delete files.
