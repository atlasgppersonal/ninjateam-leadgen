# Product Context

## Why this project exists:
- To efficiently manage and analyze arbitrage data for lead generation.
- To provide a robust system for posting processed data to an emulator for testing and further processing.

## Problems it solves:
- Incomplete or incorrect arbitrage data handling.
- Manual data posting to emulators, which is prone to errors and time-consuming.
- Lack of a clear, documented process for data verification and submission.

## How it should work:
- The system should be able to take structured arbitrage data.
- It should validate the data to ensure correctness and completeness.
- It should securely and reliably post this data to a specified emulator endpoint.
- Feedback mechanisms should be in place to confirm successful data transmission or report errors.

## User experience goals:
- Developers should find it easy to integrate and use the data posting mechanism.
- Data analysts should be confident that their arbitrage data is being processed accurately.
- The process should be transparent, allowing for easy debugging and verification.
