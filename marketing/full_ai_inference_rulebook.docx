AI Personalization & Inference Rulebook
1. Introduction & Purpose
This rulebook provides a comprehensive, structured guide for transforming raw scraped
business data into highly personalized, AI-enhanced outreach content. It defines the base
dataset, inferred data points, concern mapping, scoring/ranking logic, and final assembly
rules for dynamically generated communications.
2. Base Dataset Specification
The base dataset represents the raw, scraped or input data for a given business. This is the
foundation for all subsequent inference, concern mapping, and personalization logic.
JSON Schema Example:
{
"post_id": "<string>",
"url": "<string>",
"image_hash": "<string or null>",
"original_category": "<string>",
"body_text": "<string>",
"business_name": "<string or null>",
"category": "<string or null>",
"services_rendered": ["<string>", "..."] or null,
"name": "<string or null>",
"email": "<string or null>",
"phone": "<string or null>",
"website_url": "<string or null>"
}
Data Enrichment Example:
{
"score": "<total_points>",
"data_points": {
"business_name": "<string or null>",
"owner_name": "<string or null>",
"years_in_business": "<string or null>",
"service_area": ["<city>", "<city>", "..."] or null,
"specialized_equipment": ["<item>", "..."] or null,
"unique_selling_point": "<string or null>",

"awards_certifications": ["<award>", "..."] or null,
"seasonal_offers": "<string or null>",
"customer_testimonials": true/false,
"before_after_photos": true/false,
"blog_articles": true/false,
"community_involvement": "<string or null>",
"service_guarantee": "<string or null>",
"detailed_service_list": ["<service>", "..."] or null,
"case_studies": ["<case>", "..."] or null,
"extra_contact_methods": ["<method>", "..."] or null,
"pricing_info": "<string or null>",
"videos": true/false,
"team_info": ["<name/role>", "..."] or null,
"geo_targeted_content": ["<location>", "..."] or null,
"press_mentions": ["<mention>", "..."] or null
}
}
3. Inference Rules
Inference rules define how additional, implicit data points are derived from the base
dataset. These inferred points drive concern mapping, personalization, and AI
recommendations.
Example Inferred Data Points JSON:
{
"target_audience": ["<audience segment>", "..."],
"likely_challenges": ["<challenge>", "..."],
"competitive_positioning": "<string>",
"seasonal_factors": ["<factor>", "..."],
"location_risks": ["<risk>", "..."],
"market_opportunities": ["<opportunity>", "..."],
"potential_ai_applications": ["<application>", "..."]
}
4. Concern Matrix Construction
The concern matrix organizes potential issues and opportunities into logical categories (e.g.,
Location, Audience, Operational, Financial) with sub-factors. These are later scored and
ranked.
Example Concern Matrix JSON:


--- PAGE 2 ---

{
"Location": {
"Hurricanes": 8,
"Snow": 5,
"Drought": 4
},
"Audience": {
"Elderly": 7,
"Middle-aged": 6,
"Young adults": 4
},
"Operational": {
"Hiring shortages": 9,
"Equipment maintenance": 6
},
"Financial": {
"Cash flow": 8,
"High costs": 7
}
}
5. Scoring & Ranking Methodology
Concerns are ranked at both the category and sub-factor (leaf) level. Leaf-level concerns are
scored across all categories, enabling global ranking regardless of hierarchy.
Example Scored Output JSON:
{
"ranked_concerns": [
{"concern": "Hiring shortages", "score": 9},
{"concern": "Hurricanes", "score": 8},
{"concern": "Cash flow", "score": 8},
{"concern": "Elderly audience", "score": 7}
]
}
6. Email Section Assembly Rules
Emails are built in three dynamic sections:
Section 1: Intro (scraped web details)


--- PAGE 3 ---

Section 2: Problem framing (concerns + gravity)
Section 3: AI-driven solutions
7. Variation & Combination Generation
Each email component has multiple variants. Variants can be mixed to create unique
combinations, increasing personalization while maintaining structural consistency.
Example Variation JSON:
{
"section1_variants": ["<intro1>", "<intro2>", "..."],
"section2_variants": ["<problem1>", "<problem2>", "..."],
"section3_variants": ["<solution1>", "<solution2>", "..."]
}
