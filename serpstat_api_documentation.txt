API Methods and Flow

Description for all available methods of Serpstat SERP Scraper Api

At the core of SERP Scraper service lies an elegant three-step process flow that ensures deep SERP analysis:

1. Initialize

Through the API interface, you submit a request to analyze a set of keywords considering the specifics of your chosen search region. This ensures obtaining maximally relevant data for your target geolocation.

Use method addTask to submit your keyword list to parsing. This method is suitable for tasks with one or a small number of keywords.

Use method addKeywordList to add up to 10,000 keywords per top parsing task.

Both methods returns task_id, save it for the future, to get results.

If some of your keywords doesn't meet the common validation criteria you would receive non empty array blocked_keywords in response:

{
  "id": "123",
  "result": {
    "task_id": "5492895",
    "blocked_keywords": [
      "*****"
    ]
  }
}

Blocked keywords are not charged and can't be parsed by our API. They won't be included in the parsing task.

These references help you to choose the right ones id's for:

language
search region
country code
2. Wait till it's done

Usually, top parsing takes up to 2-3 minutes depending to task size and service load.

Use method getTaskResult to get results. If task is not complete you will receive response like that

{
  "id": "123",
  "result": {
    "progress": "0%",
    "message": "Not all keywords have been tracked"
  }
}

The system provides real-time task status updates, ensuring complete transparency of the data collection process. Use method

3. Get results!

Use method getTaskResult to get results again after little while. Upon completion of the analysis, you receive structured search results data for your keywords list. Each result contains detailed information about positions, meta-data, and other key SEO parameters found in SERP like that:

{
  "id": "123",
  "result": {
    "task_meta": {
      "se_id": "1",

                    "Is it okay to eat jalapeno as a snack?"
                  ]
                }

          ]
        },
        "target_fields": "[]"
      }
    ]
  }
}

In this example, we've used one keyword and shrunk the response to 1 position in SERP. Of course, you will get 99-100 positions in the real world, depending on special elements.

More methods to up your awareness.
Get your task history.

Method getList allows getting a list of required tasks with status for the last 7 days. After 7 days all completted task will be purged.

Get raw SERP.

The getKeywordSerp method returns the raw SERP in HTML format. To get results you must use keyword_id parameter from method getTaskResult response instead of keyword in string representation.

Control your balance.

The getParsingBalance method return your balance and current price for one SERP parsing for the keyword.

{
  "id": "123",
  "result": {
    "available_usd": "99999.891", <-- your balance
    "serp_parsing_cost": "0.0004",  <-- your price for one SERP
    "volume_parsing_cost": "0.0006"


  }
}

Please note: price is always negotiable! :)
