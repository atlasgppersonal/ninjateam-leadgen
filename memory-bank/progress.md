# Progress

## What works:
- Initial setup of the `test_save_arbitrage.py` script with URL and data.
- Creation of the project-specific `memory-bank` directory.
- Creation of `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md` within the `memory-bank` directory.

## What's left to build:
- Complete the Python code in `test_save_arbitrage.py` to send the HTTP POST request.
- Implement error handling and success logging in the Python script.
- Execute the script to post data to the emulator.

## Current status:
- Memory bank structure initialized.
- Ready to proceed with completing the `test_save_arbitrage.py` script.

## Known issues:
- None at this stage.

## Evolution of project decisions:
- Decided to move memory bank files to a project-specific directory for better organization and context management.
