# Proposed Scoring Mechanism for Conversion Probability

To score the conversion probability based on city and category, we can consider a multi-factor approach. This score will help prioritize our outreach efforts.

## Factors to Consider:

1.  **Economic Health of the City**: A thriving economy generally indicates more businesses with higher budgets and a greater need for services.
    -   **Indicators**: Median Household Income, Median Property Value, Employed Population Growth, Largest Industries (relevance to AI/automation services).
    -   **Scoring**: Higher values in these indicators would lead to a higher score.

2.  **Demographic Alignment with Target Audience**: The demographic profile of the city should align with the typical target audience for AI/automation services (e.g., SMB owners, specific age groups, income levels).
    -   **Indicators**: Median Age, Income Levels, Presence of relevant industries (e.g., Professional, Scientific, & Technical Services).
    -   **Scoring**: Better alignment with target audience demographics would result in a higher score.

3.  **Business Density and Growth in Relevant Categories**: The number of businesses in target categories (e.g., Plumbing, HVAC, Hospitality, Service Trades) and their growth rate within the city.
    -   **Indicators**: Number of businesses in relevant NAICS codes, business formation rates.
    -   **Scoring**: Higher density and growth would lead to a higher score.

4.  **Competitive Landscape**: The level of competition for AI/automation services in the given city and category.
    -   **Indicators**: Number of existing AI/automation service providers, market saturation.
    -   **Scoring**: Lower competition would result in a higher score.

5.  **Specific Local Concerns/Opportunities**: Unique challenges or opportunities identified for a city or category (e.g., hurricane season in Florida, specific local regulations, tech hubs).
    -   **Indicators**: Mentions of specific concerns in local news/reports, presence of innovation hubs.
    -   **Scoring**: Higher relevance of concerns that AI/automation can solve, or unique opportunities, would increase the score.

## Scoring Methodology (Example - to be refined):

Each indicator can be assigned a weight based on its importance. A weighted sum can then be calculated to derive a composite conversion probability score.

```
Conversion Score = (W1 * Economic Health Score) + (W2 * Demographic Alignment Score) + (W3 * Business Density Score) + (W4 * Competitive Landscape Score) + (W5 * Local Concerns/Opportunities Score)
```

**Next Steps**: I will need to define specific metrics for each indicator and assign weights. This will likely require further research into industry-specific data and competitive analysis for each city and category. I will also start identifying key concerns and potential solutions based on the collected data and general knowledge of SMB challenges.



## Refined Scoring Mechanism with Initial Metrics and Weights

Here's a more refined scoring mechanism with initial metrics and proposed weights. These weights can be adjusted based on further analysis or user feedback.

### 1. Economic Health of the City (Weight: 0.30)
- **Median Household Income Growth (last 1 year)**: Higher growth indicates a more dynamic economy. (Score: 0-10, e.g., >5% growth = 10, 2-5% = 7, <2% = 3)
- **Employed Population Growth (last 1 year)**: Indicates job market strength and business expansion. (Score: 0-10, e.g., >1.5% growth = 10, 0.5-1.5% = 7, <0.5% = 3)
- **Median Property Value Growth (last 1 year)**: Reflects economic confidence and investment. (Score: 0-10, e.g., >10% growth = 10, 5-10% = 7, <5% = 3)

### 2. Demographic Alignment with Target Audience (Weight: 0.25)
- **Median Age**: Alignment with typical SMB owner age (e.g., 35-55). (Score: 0-10, closer to ideal range = 10)
- **Income Levels**: Higher median household income suggests more disposable income for business investments. (Score: 0-10, e.g., >$80k = 10, $60-80k = 7, <$60k = 3)
- **Presence of Key Industries**: Proportion of workforce in industries relevant to AI/automation (e.g., Professional, Scientific, & Technical Services). (Score: 0-10, higher percentage = 10)

### 3. Business Density and Growth in Relevant Categories (Weight: 0.20)
- **Number of Businesses in Target Categories**: Absolute number of businesses in categories like Plumbing, HVAC, Hospitality, etc. (Score: 0-10, higher number = 10)
- **Business Formation Rate**: Rate of new business creation. (Score: 0-10, higher rate = 10)

### 4. Competitive Landscape (Weight: 0.15)
- **Number of AI/Automation Service Providers**: Lower competition is better. (Score: 0-10, fewer competitors = 10)
- **Market Saturation**: Perceived saturation of the market. (Score: 0-10, lower saturation = 10)

### 5. Specific Local Concerns/Opportunities (Weight: 0.10)
- **Relevance of AI/Automation to Local Concerns**: How well AI/automation can address prevalent local issues (e.g., hurricane preparedness for Florida businesses). (Score: 0-10, higher relevance = 10)
- **Presence of Innovation Hubs/Tech Adoption**: Indicates a more receptive market for new technologies. (Score: 0-10, presence of tech hubs = 10)

## Example Calculation for a City/Category:

Let's say for Orlando, FL and the 


Plumbing category, we assign scores for each indicator:

-   **Economic Health**: (0.30)
    -   Median Household Income Growth: 7 (4.49% growth)
    -   Employed Population Growth: 7 (0.624% growth)
    -   Median Property Value Growth: 7 (7.91% growth)
    -   *Sub-score*: (7+7+7)/3 = 7

-   **Demographic Alignment**: (0.25)
    -   Median Age: 8 (35.1, close to ideal)
    -   Income Levels: 7 ($69,268, good)
    -   Presence of Key Industries: 7 (Professional, Scientific, & Technical Services is a large industry)
    -   *Sub-score*: (8+7+7)/3 = 7.33

-   **Business Density and Growth**: (0.20)
    -   Number of Businesses in Target Categories: (Needs specific data, assume 7 for now)
    -   Business Formation Rate: (Needs specific data, assume 7 for now)
    -   *Sub-score*: (7+7)/2 = 7

-   **Competitive Landscape**: (0.15)
    -   Number of AI/Automation Service Providers: (Needs specific data, assume 6 for now)
    -   Market Saturation: (Needs specific data, assume 6 for now)
    -   *Sub-score*: (6+6)/2 = 6

-   **Specific Local Concerns/Opportunities**: (0.10)
    -   Relevance of AI/Automation to Local Concerns (e.g., hurricane preparedness for plumbing): 9
    -   Presence of Innovation Hubs/Tech Adoption: 7
    -   *Sub-score*: (9+7)/2 = 8

**Overall Conversion Score for Orlando Plumbing (Example):**

(0.30 * 7) + (0.25 * 7.33) + (0.20 * 7) + (0.15 * 6) + (0.10 * 8) =
2.1 + 1.8325 + 1.4 + 0.9 + 0.8 = **7.0325**

This score would be calculated for each city and relevant category. The next step is to gather more specific data for
